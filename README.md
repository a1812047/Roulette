# Roulette
Russian Roulette , very famous Casino game. 
Implemented in a Object-Oriented style using C++ dedicated to console style input and output 
The game starts with 1000 coins and the player can decide to play until they have the coins.
The table uses some time function to help users place some bets within a time limit.

#child of the game
Red and black, odd and even , single number and so on.. 
there are different types of games within a game. 
this game therefore treats Roulette board as an abstract parent class. 
Roulette therefore is only a game when either one of the child instance is called upon. 

Keeping this definition in mind this game turns out to be a very simple implementation using OOP.
